overide the methods in abstract class.
Promote common behaviour.
Abstract class don't have instance of its own.
Coz then abstarct methods are called. then jvm feels which body to execute. to avoid the situation it tells to not create a project.

Abstarct class means something is incomplete.


Class is marked as abstract?
Because it has one or more abstract methods.
thats because it gives a compiler error.
Class abstarct can't create an instance.


any overloaded constructor can be invoked with super can be used with the signature.

is a relation means we are talking about subclass.
can I have a class abstarct with all methods having body.
Its possible.

_______________Interface__________________
it is a delegate(pass on karna)
It has all methods abstarct thats the difference between the two.
It outlines the features but don't provide implmentation.
Functionalities ke features ko outline karta hai.
It only speaks about what and not how.
It needs a seperate class that implements interface.
then overrride the methods.
Eg; mobile data has the different facilities.
It does not provide implementation--> we get a subsriper like airtel or vodafone.

Diff classes can sum up and provide the implementation.
from javva 8 they have default or static methods and then only can have a body to it.

final static is a constant Needs to initialze it at the sam etime.

By default its public and abstract in methods.
In abstract need to mark explicitly.s

extend and interface has is a relationship.
runtime poly can

Important overide rule.
can have same or wider acess modifiers.

feature chd ke baaki chezein hai toh abstract banao nahit oth interface.
interface helps to promote loose coupling.
Always use interface design wise wherever necesaary.

Quiz===========================================
when casting always use instanceof for check.

final class can't be inherited.
String clas si final and the wrapper class.

protected is accesable only as inherited method.
package mein dhundega sabse pehle class ko.

default walla alag package mein accessible nahi hoga.
trim removes spaces from left and right side.

compiler error pe line likhn ek ebaad red line aati hai.
Run tym error onsole pe dikhti hai.

Arrays are treated as an object in Java.

try cat be followed by either cath , finally or both.
