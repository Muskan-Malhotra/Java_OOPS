//	@Override
//	public boolean equals(Object o) {
//		//needs to typecast coz AccNo is not in Object Obvio!
//		return this.AccNo == ((Acc)o).AccNo;
//	}

When the equals is and is not overiden
//when equals is not overriden --> false
		System.out.println("Steve is present or not? "+present);
		
		
		boolean present2 = ac.contains(new Acc("Noel Shaw",103,10000)); //when equals is overriden --> true

1) Equals of the object class is used to check whether it the object element of a different class is contained or not.

Equlas needs to be overriden only when we are creating our own elements with objects from a class.

There is a difference between comparable and comparator.
When we need to sort something on more than one basis.
comparable se ek hi baar sort ho skata hai ek hi type pe.
but comparator se differnet cases mein use ho sakta hai..

comparable interface is implemented with compareTo() method overriden

comparator interface is implemented with compare() method overriden.
By default the return type is double which we need to convert to int as type cast.
compare also takes two parameters emploee e1 and employee e2.

Type is very important while implementing comparator or comparable.

for reference

Whenever there is an error in this line:  sst.add(e1);
the check for files which file has been provided for objects

Error: must override super method means type not provided in the implementation <ACC> within angular brackets.

 Exception : java.lang.ClassCastException :: do check if the class is may be wit the same name and you are making changes in some other class. in some other package.


when casting type casting not done properly..
Yah run method call kiya bina runnable implement karaye uss class pe.
_______________ Getter and Setters ________________
Getters and setters wahan use hote hai jis class mein variables ki declare and defined anhi hote and humein unki values chahiye hoti hai kisi or class mein!

Toh unki value set yah display karne ke liye hum constructor walli class ka object bana ke getter and setter call kar dete hain!!
