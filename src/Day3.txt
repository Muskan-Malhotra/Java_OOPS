compiler calls the tostring method. It shows the hascode value ]. To string return the string represtation of the obj.

getclass() gives associated name.
In order to print the property value of the object: 

In java we mostly use toString(){


Is a relationship: employee refrence Emp pointing to emolyee or pointing to manager obj

derived obj can be derived to base.
super reference can pt to subcalss obj.

sub class is a super class. coz all properties are there.
vice versa can't be posible.

in order to overide it needs to be inherited first.

private methods cannot be overriden.
Those methods that are visible can be overriden.

final modifier: can't be overiden.
When something is final. then we can't overide it.
class lvl final can't extent that class.
not available for modification.

string is already final in java.
All methods in string class is final.
concat, toupper, to lower case.

nobody sould midfy it is the req then final is required.

one initiliase it final var can't be modified.

final static is taken as a compile time constant.
static always used in class.
final static needs to be initialised then an there!

for compile time const always in caps.

Is a relation is checked by: 

parent type refrence always for compile time polymorphism


Even if single abstract is there then mark it as abstrac class;

Abstract refrence is allowed.
Can't instantiate the abstract class.
Abstract class ka obj nhi bana sakte.
Inheritance ke liye toh available hai!!

for compilaton purpose we used @override.
