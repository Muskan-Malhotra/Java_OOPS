generalized methods that has functions.
Giving types is generic.
add(E),remove(E),size(),contains(E),clear()
genrics : the type of the element.
Type of the collection was not possible before java 5.
Collection is supposed to have similar type of data type.
Compiler stops to add any other type than defined.
every compiler eeror is not bad.
Coz issue is created at the run it is good to understand the and correct the code beforehand.
JVM error is much hectic than the compiler error. Which can be corrected at the same time.
Compiler error is kinf of helps from exception of jvm errors.

will lst(6,10) having 4 elements in the arraylist will give index outof bound error
set and  add is differnet: set means to replace value and the value need to be present. so it will give error.

how does contains check if element is present or not: linear search se for integers.
Equals methos is used to compare. for Int
toString is overiden,
When there is an object.: equals ko override nhi kiya toh it gives false.
Equals yahan obj class call ho jayega. Or wo obj class equal method mein same memory loc ka bolega.

but wehen we overide the equals method in the obj class.
Signature very imp hai. public boolean equals(Object o)

Random  insertion and deletion is faster in LL
Hashiing is used to reduce the number of seraching.
While storing it is stored in buckets and then there is a specific hash key.

Hash code method is overwridden. here also comparison happens with equals. It will ensure no duplicacy is there.

First call hascode to find the bucket
to add eements then check for duplicacy and then only add the element in the bucckets.

add and contains is different.
duplicate add nhi karne dega but contains sirf compare karega.

set mein add karte time wo search karta rahega..number of comaprisons will be drastically reduced.
Hashcode overide nhi kiya toh 
object hashcode value will have differnet memeory loc and then every duplicate employee ka bhi diff hashcode hoga.
or wo duplicacy pe false dega isiliye do baar raj malhotra add hogye..

nothing tp comp and simply putting in 4 different buckets.
same bucket mein elemns honge toh compare honge or id duplicate hogi.
chaaron ki jhscode waali vlaue alag ayi oth chaaron ko lag buckets mein add kar diya.

ordered: need not means sorted.
means a sequence is followed
sorted means orderd.

hashset is not sorted nor ordered
AL is ordered not sorted

________Treeset_________
sorted set interface. is used.
lower case and uppercase is compared accordingly..its case sensitive.
duplicacy not allowed
Employee pe sorting not working coz comparable class of java.lang nhi chala.

Compareto swap the prev with next;
if prev-next is negative means prev is smalle rtha next;

if hashing so sorting will be done inside bucket.
comparto is a part of coparable interface.
implement the comparable interface. and overide the compareto in the employee

so we need to implement it! the comparable interface.
this.wmpid is prev implicityly passed and next is e.empid passed explicitly.

Now Comparator Interface()
Abstract methods needs to be overriden.
convention means which is generally followed.
Empty constructor comparable dhundega!! sort ke liye.

______________lambda __________________--
Agar interface mein ek hi method hai toh hi labda se hoga yeh..
do hua toh nhi use hoga lambda walla
