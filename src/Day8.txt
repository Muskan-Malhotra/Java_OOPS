-----------------Java 8--------------------
In java 8 we have the static and default in interface.
Abstarct methods need to override.
Static method can be used in interface.
Default methods are for utility.
Jiski implmentation change nhihogi.
Or else just have interface with only abstract method.

Function which is implemented inside multiple statements.

//lambda function/lambda expression

(arg1,arg2) -> {
stat1;
stat2;
java block

return val;
}

coding a function in java
//lambda function syntax
(arg1) -> stat1;

In the cases when we need to overide a mthod in an interface where there is only one abstract method inside it.

When we need to overide the same emthod we can direclty do it with lambda expression.


//all becoz of lambda
		//class ban jayega
		or method override ho jayegi
		instance will be created as well
